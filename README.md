## About The Project

The weather app called "Classy Weather" is an innovative and aesthetic platform that allows users to easily and quickly view the weather of any city. The application has unique features that help users to get clear and informative information about today's weather and the next 6 days.

### Main functions:

- City Search: "Classy Weather" allows users to search by name of any city and the app will instantly display weather data for the current and upcoming days.

- Visual Experience: The application assigns a unique and eye-catching image to each city's weather, so users can easily identify the cities and the specific weather conditions.

- Weekly Forecast: The application provides a detailed weekly forecast that includes daily maximum and minimum temperatures.

- Country Display: Based on the search city, the application automatically displays the country of the given city, so users receive extensive information about the city's geographical location.

"Classy Weather" weather app is a modern and customizable tool that helps users in their daily decisions and planning with accurate and detectable weather data. With visual sophistication and easy-to-understand information, the app provides a high-quality weather experience for all users.

## What I learned

The "Classy Weather" weather app project has taught me many important lessons that have contributed to increasing my development skills and experience. During the project I learned:

React Application Development: I delved into the React application development process.

API integration: I learned about the integration of the API providing weather data and the management of the data derived from them.

Handling asynchronous operations: While dealing with asynchronous operations while retrieving and updating weather data, I learned how to handle these operations efficiently and quickly in React.

Project structure and modular coding: I learned how to organize project code in a modular and structured way so that it is easy to maintain and easy to expand in the future.

Together, these knowledge and skills contribute to my ability to develop and maintain a modern, interactive web application. The experiences gained during the project can also help me to work even more confidently and efficiently on my future developments.
